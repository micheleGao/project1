# Trivia_game:
This game was inspired from testings ones memory, or knowledge on the basis of entertainment. These sets of questions that were used were questions that were frequently asked in some trivia. 

The questions used were from this site:
"https://www.quizbreaker.com/trivia-questions"

### Technologies used:
1. script. js : loops(for of, for each), object, array, event listeners, callback and DOM manipulation.
2. style.css : grid
3. index.html: modal (from bootstrap)

### Game Description:
This game only has a set of five questions, and once the player has finished selecting their answers in the choices provided by the radio button. Once submitted the answers are then evaluated by the computer to see if it is true.


### Win Conditions:
winning conditions are if you scored above 20 with the correct answers which is then evaluated by the values given in the radio to the the value of the correct answer, before the timer ends.

### Lose Conditions:
Losing conditions is scored below 20, so if you don't submit anything before the timer ends, your score will populate at the end of the page and the restart button will then refresh the page again to start over.

## Lessons/ongoing issues:
- I originally had planned to create a carousel which switched from one question to the next. However, giving it some thought, I wanted a foundation to build on. During wireframing, it had dawned on me, it was going to be more challenging then intended. I had settled for a MVP so it is in working order and I can build onto it with  more levels and more questions. I also had some trouble dealing with the radio buttons, not understanding they were in an array, so checking for then being checked off and evaluating their values of  the correct answer in the object I created made it a bit messier than intended.
    
### ongoing issues - There is alot of code, and I feel like it could be a bit messy than I would like it to be.  

## Focusing on user experience:
- This game isnt suppose to be hard since, its just the first level. I also tried to make the fonts a bit more exciting, and have a timer, so they dont feel like they are being quizzed, but more of a game. 

### Lessons learned:
- Creating a game is hard, especially for someone who doesnt usually game on a regular basis, but coming from the person making it, the game logic is hard to come up with when there are things you are evaluating and checking off along the way.

## Current Status:
- WIP.
